Description: Native Abstractions for Node.js
 A header file filled with macro and utility goodness for making addon
 development for Node.js easier across versions.
 .
 Keeping native addons compiling happily across versions, particularly
 is a minor nightmare, due to API/ABI incompatibilities.
 The goal of this project is to store
 all logic necessary to develop native Node.js addons without having to
 inspec NODE_MODULE_VERSION and get yourself into a macro-tangle.
 .
 This project also contains some helper utilities that make addon
 development a bit more pleasant.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
